# muRisQ-basics by Marc Henrard

muRisQ Advisory open source code with basic implementations.

muRisQ stands for Management of Risk by Quantitative methods. The term risk management has to be understood in a large sense which includes risk strategies, ALM, quantitative impacts of regulation, and trading strategies.

# Repository content

This repository proposes foundation code to be used for several asset classes and for analysis.

The models implemented are based on proprietary research and academic literature as described in each implementation.

Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcome.

## Foundations

Some code proposed in this repository is based on OpenGamma Strata (version 2.6.0) library: http://strata.opengamma.io/

## Professional services

The models proposed here are only a small part of the code I developed or have access to for research and advisory services purposes. Don’t hesitate to contact me if you are interested by other models, require advisory services or are looking for a training around similar models.

## Trainings and workshops

We propose in-house training and workshops on subjects related to quantitative finance and risk management.

We offer extensive flexibility on the training organization.

A in-house tailor-made course with our experts presented to your full team often cost less than sending two people to a standard course organized by a large training firm.

*Agenda tailored to your needs. Detailed lecture notes.*
*Associated to open source code for practical implementation.*
*Training in English or French*

Some of the popular courses are (course description and typical agendas available through the links):
* Multi-curve and collateral framework: foundations, evolution and implementation. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#multicurve>
* The future of LIBOR: Quantitative perspective on benchmarks, overnight, fallback and regulation. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#libor-future>
* Algorithmic Differentiation in Finance. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#ad>
* Central clearing and bilateral margin. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#margin>
