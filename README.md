This repository proposes basic code used in derivative pricing and analysis.

muRisQ stands for Management of Risk by Quantitative methods. The term risk management has to be understood as the actual management of risk, which goes beyond its measurement.

Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcomed.

## Foundations

Some code proposed in this repository is based on OpenGamma Strata (version 2.2.0) library: http://strata.opengamma.io/


## Professional services

The models proposed here are only a small part of the code I developed or have access to for research and advisory services purposes. Don’t hesitate to contact me if you are interested by other models, require advisory services or are looking for a training around similar models.

### Training

We propose in-house training and workshops on subjects related to quantitative finance and risk management.

We offer extensive flexibility on the training organization.

A in-house tailor-made course with our experts presented to your full team often cost less than sending two people to a standard course organized by a large training firm.

*Agenda tailored to your needs. Detailed lecture notes.*
*Associated to open source code for practical implementation.*
*Training in English or French*

Some of the popular courses are (course description and typical agendas available through the links):
* Multi-curve and collateral framework: foundations, evolution and implementation. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#multicurve>
* The future of LIBOR: Quantitative perspective on benchmarks, overnight, fallback and regulation. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#libor-future>
* Algorithmic Differentiation in Finance. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#ad>
* Central clearing and bilateral margin. <https://murisq.blogspot.com/p/training.html#margin>
