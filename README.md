This repository proposes basic code used in derivative pricing and analysis.

muRisQ stands for Management of Risk by Quantitative methods. The term risk management has to be understood as the actual management of risk, which goes beyond its measurement.

Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcomed.

## Foundations

Some code proposed in this repository is based on OpenGamma Strata (version 1.7.0) library: http://strata.opengamma.io/


## Professional services

The model proposed here are only a small part of the code I developed or have access to for research and advisory services purposes. Donâ€™t hesitate to contact me if you are interested by other models, require advisory services or are looking for a training around similar model.

### Training
